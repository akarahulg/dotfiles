    ### Display ###
    # Which monitor to display notifications on. 0 is the primary monitor.

    #  - "focus"  (follow the focused window)
    #  - "center" (center of the screen)
    follow = mouse

    ### Geometry ###
    # The format is "widthxheight[+/-]x[+/-]y".
    # This example places notifications in the top-right corner.
    #  - 350x10: 350px wide, 10px high (height is dynamic, so this is a minimum)

    ### Text & Font ###
    # A good, modern font. Nerd Fonts are great for icons.

    # The format of the notification.
    #  - %a: application name
    #  - %s: summary (the title)
    #  - %b: body (the main text)
    #  - %I: path to icon
    #  - %p: progress value
    # You can use Pango markup for formatting (e.g., <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>).
    # This format shows a bold title and the body on a new line.
    format = "<b>%s</b>\n%b"

    # Alignment of text.
    #  - "left"
    #  - "center"
    #  - "right"
